# Graphical User Interface (CUI)

Can use different command line user interface libraries, or built from scratch GUI

Each will have their own directory under this one, each being a concrete device, where the GUI Interface driver will reside in this directory.  Example - Qt5 and Qt6 different Java versions might each have their own directories.
