"""
The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which
an object maintains a list of its dependents ("observers"), 
and notifies them of any state changes â€“ usually by calling
a callback function provided by the observer.

This file is a simple example of using psygnal, slightly
modified from: https://psygnal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# create an instance
my_obj = MyObject()

# You (or others) can connect callbacks to your signals
