# proto diretory README.md

Examples, or prototypes on using parts or sections of functionality of the program code.  None of this code can be relied upon to be stable, although there is an outside chance it might be, but might become broken at any time due to attempts to improve functionality.

Once a script or piece of code is stable, if the deemed complete enough, reliable, clean and useful enough code to do so, a snapshot of it, with a version number, can be migrated to the examples directory.

### Time based version:

Consider using version number follows the following in 24hour format: 
-v.YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.[py|md|pdf|etc]

Shorter CalVer:

YYYY.MM.(patch-number)
or
YY.MM.DD

### Semantic version (SemVer):

Or using [Semantic](https://semver.org) versioning:
-X.X.X.[py|md|pdf|etc]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)

### SemVer vs. CalVer
