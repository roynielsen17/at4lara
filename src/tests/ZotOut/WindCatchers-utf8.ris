AB  - Mechanical cooling systems in buildings are the main producers of carbon dioxide emissions, which have negative impacts on environment and amplify global warming, particularly in hot climate. Due to the lack of energy supply, windcatchers can be utilized as a sustainable attempt for cooling and ventilation purposes. The objective of this paper is to review and provide a comprehensive literature on windcatcher system for space cooling and ventilation. The concepts were discussed according to the relevant parameters of windcatcher, i.e. windcatcher attributes, windcatcher configurations and windcatcher technologies. The pros and cons of this green architectural feature have also been highlighted and the future research need in this realm of study is proposed.

TI  - Wind catcher: passive and low energy cooling system in iranian vernacular architecture

AB  - Environmental and natural phenomena play a very significant role in laying the region's interrelated cultural, economic and social infrastructures. The buildings in the Iranian desert regions are constructed according to the specific climatic conditions and differ with those built in other climates. Due to lack of access to modern heating and cooling equipment in ancient times the architects were obliged to rely on natural energies to render the inside condition of the buildings pleasant. In the past, without modern facilities, it was only the intelligent architecture of the buildings that enabled people to tolerate the hot summer. The ventilation structures called Badgirs were the most important means by which the interior was cooled. The wind-catcher operates according to the condition of the wind and sun radiation in the region. In ancient times and in traditional buildings in arid and dry regions the air trap functioned like the present modern air conditioning system. Wind-catcher is like a chimney whose end is in the underground and the top is set over a specific height on the roof and were built at the entrance of the house over underground water reservoirs or ponds built inside the house. The dry and warm wind will pass over a pond with a fountain gets cool and wet through evaporation. The Badgir's material again plays another role. Due to high fluctuation of temperature differences between day and night in this climate and night time coldness, Badgir which is made with mud-brick, gets cool by radiation and convection. The system works, when there is no wind, but when wind is blowing this system does not have problems. Because during the day, if there is wind, then cool air flows faster and at night, with wind, it may absorb the heat of the walls, because the night wind is cool enough.

AB  - The signiﬁcant energy use and increasing requirement for good indoor environment quality in the built environment have led to a renewed interest in natural ventilation strategies such as windcatchers. Windcatcher is a roof-mounted device that supplies fresh airﬂow into a room and expels polluted air under the action of wind pressure and buoyancy forces. The aim of this review is to investigate factors which affect the natural ventilation performance of windcatcher including internal factors (related to geometry/design of windcatcher), external building features (microclimate) and surrounding environment (macroclimate) plus the impact of integration with other passive systems. From reviewing the literature, it was found that windcatcher with a square cross-section and curved roof demonstrates better ventilation in the room compared to other conﬁgurations. Moreover, the overall ﬁndings indicated that the integration of windcatcher with other natural ventilation systems such as solar chimney and wing wall has a considerable effect on the ventilation efﬁciency. In urban environments, buildings are often located quite close to each other, and the effect of surrounding structures on airﬂow proﬁle cannot be ignored but only a limited number of works considered the impact of urban environment and objects (upstream or downstream) on the ventilation efﬁciency of windcatcher. Finally, the impact of vegetation, techno-economic cost and energy saving in a building are some signiﬁcant gaps of current studies.
